## Elizabeth Wood, PhD

>Elizabeth Wood is the founder and CEO of [JURA Bio](https://www.jurabio.com/), where she leads the development of AI-native drug discovery through breakthrough technologies that bridge computational design and physical synthesis.

>JURA Bio [recently announced](https://www.jurabio.com/blog/variationalsynthesis) the development of a novel generative machine learning architecture for the design of proteins called [variational synthesis](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2024.09.13.612900v2), a breakthrough in the synthesis bottleneck constraining our ability to build and test AI-designed proteins at scale. Variational synthesis has applications in enhancing drug discovery and understanding complex biological systems, leveraging machine learning and synthetic biology for precision medicine. It also allows for the building and testing of of trillions AI-designed candidates.

>Before founding JURA, Wood was a post-doc in the lab of [Adam Cohen](http://cohenweb.rc.fas.harvard.edu/) at Harvard's Department of Chemistry and Physics. She pursued her PhD with [Angela Belcher](http://belcherlab.mit.edu/) and [Markus Buehler](http://lamm.mit.edu/) at MIT, and finished it under the supervision of [Claus Helix-Nielsen](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=VLFQdvsAAAAJ&hl=en) at The Technical University of Denmark, Departments of Physics and Civil and Environmental Engineering. She has also worked at the University of Copenhagenâ€™s SBiN Lab with [Kresten Lindorff-Larsen](https://www1.bio.ku.dk/english/research/bms/research/sbinlab/groups/kll/), integrating computational methods with experimental studies to better predict RNA structure and to understand how the ability of proteins to change their shape helps modulate their function.
 
>Wood is a visiting scientist at the [Broad Institute](https://www.broadinstitute.org/), where she served on the founding steering committee of [the Models, Inference & Algorithms (MIA) Initiative](https://www.broadinstitute.org/MIA). From 2019-2021 she served as the primary organizer of the NeurIPS Workshop [Learning Meaningful Representations of Life](https://lmrl.org). She currently serves on the board of Project Clio, a Massachusetts-based 501(c)3 non-profit dedicated to advancing the study of the health impacts of pregnancy and understudied autoimmune diseases.

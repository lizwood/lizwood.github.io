## Elizabeth Wood, PhD
> Elizabeth Wood is the founder and CEO of [JURA Bio](https://www.jurabio.com), where she leads the development of AI-native drug discovery technologies that solve the fundamental bottlenecks in biological machine learning.

> JURA builds de novo AI models that build the real-world data they need to learn. Under Wood's leadership, JURA has developed an integrated platform combining [variational synthesis](https://www.jurabio.com/blog/variationalsynthesis) (1000T+ real-world designs), [VISTA screening](https://www.jurabio.com/blog/vista) (1B+ functional measurements per campaign), and [LeaVS](https://www.jurabio.com/blog/leavs) (orders-of-magnitude information gain). This technology has enabled the discovery of millions of fully functional hits across multiplexed therapeutic targets, validated CAR designs, and TCR-mimicking antibodies against previously undruggable targets.

> Wood earned her PhD at MIT and the Technical University of Denmark, followed by postdoctoral work at Harvard with Adam Cohen. She is a Visiting Scientist at the [Broad Institute](https://www.broadinstitute.org), an Affiliate of the [Pioneer Centre for AI](https://www.aicentre.dk), served on the steering committee of the [Models, Inference & Algorithms Initiative](https://www.broadinstitute.org/mia), and organized the multi-year NeurIPS Workshop on [Learning Meaningful Representations of Life](https://www.lmrl.org). She currently serves on the board of Project Clio.
